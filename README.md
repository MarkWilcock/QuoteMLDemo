# QuoteMLDemo

This is short tutorial R code to demo a simple regression example using R.

The scenario is to classify quotes into buy or sell intention based on details of the counterparty and the product for which the quote is being obtained.

Banks are asked by a counterparty to quote both the sell and buy price of a financial  instrument, such as a bond or a currency.  This is often called the bid-offer price.  An example may be 102.46 (bid) to 102.50 (offer) meaning that the bank is prepered to buy a given amount of the instrument at 102.46 and to sell at the slightly higher price of 102.50.  The counterpary can then state their intent whether to buy or sell to the bank - or neither.

It would be useful for the bank to have more than a 50:50 guess at the counterparty's intent given a history of previously executed quote.
